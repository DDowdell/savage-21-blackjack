How to Play Blackjack: (Rules sourced from Google Search)
1. Place your bet: Before the cards are dealt, players must place a bet. The minimum and maximum bets are usually posted on the table.
2. Receive your cards: Once all bets have been placed, the dealer will deal two cards to each player, face up.
3. Decide to hit or stand: After receiving your two cards, you can choose to "hit" and receive additional cards or "stand" and keep your
current hand.
4. Dealer's turn: After all players have had their turn, the dealer will reveal their face-down card and hit or stand according to
predetermined rules.
5. Determine the winner: If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the person with the highest
Value wins.
